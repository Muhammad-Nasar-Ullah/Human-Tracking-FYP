Here is the correct workflow for a collaborator:

They Clone the Code: They run git clone ... to get the code (including the requirements.txt I just added).
They Create their OWN venv:
python -m venv .venv
..venv\Scripts\activate
They Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt (This installs all the libraries you are using).
They Add Videos:
Since videos are excluded, they will have an empty backend/videos/ folder.
Yes, you can send them the video files separately (via Drive, USB, etc.), OR they can simply drop any random mp4 file into backend/videos/ to test it.
